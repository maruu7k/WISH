          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            The genesis of <span class="wish-title"> ‘Wish’ </span> was rooted
            in a collective belief that every child, regardless of their
            circumstances, should have the opportunity to experience the joys of
            play intertwined with valuable learning experiences. This vision
            emerged from the profound understanding that well-chosen educational
            toys can be powerful tools in a child's development. <br />
            <br />
            The name <span class="wish-title"> ‘Wish’ </span>originates from our
            guiding motto -
            <span class="wish-title"> ‘Tend to Wish’. </span> This slogan
            encapsulates our mission to nurture dreams and potential through
            play. It embodies our dedication to creating opportunities for
            children to learn, grow, and, most importantly, to dream. <br />
            <br />
            Motivated by this insight, a dedicated group of individuals came
            together to form <span class="wish-title"> ‘Wish’. </span> Their
            mission was clear: to provide educational toys to children who might
            not have access to them otherwise. This initiative became a beacon
            of hope, offering a gateway to learning and growth for countless
            young minds. <br />
            <br />
            As the word spread about our mission, a community of supporters
            rallied behind us. Some generously contributed financial resources
            to procure more educational toys, while others volunteered their
            time and expertise to ensure the toys reached the hands of deserving
            children. <br />
            <br />
            Today, <span class="wish-title"> ‘Wish’ </span> stands as a
            testament to the impact that can be achieved through collective
            action. Each donated toy, every financial contribution, and the
            invaluable hours invested by our dedicated volunteers have
            collectively made a profound difference in the lives of many
            children. <br />
            <br />
            Reflecting on this journey,
            <span class="wish-title"> ‘Wish’ </span>remains resolute in its
            commitment to fostering growth and learning through play. This
            narrative is not just a reflection of our progress, but a solemn
            pledge to the children we serve - affirming that their potential is
            boundless, and we are here to support their journey towards a
            brighter future.
